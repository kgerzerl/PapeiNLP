Despite experiencing some delays and less effective communication during the past few days, the team demonstrated their dedication to paper-based work and collaborating effectively. I think we should all be thankful for the acceptance and efforts of all of us until the Springer link finally arrived last week. In case the doctor decides to revise the acknowledgments section before resending again, please keep this in mind.
